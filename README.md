# Social Media Opinion Mining Based on Bangla Public Post of Facebook
Social media holds the freedom to express anyone
as they are. Still, people fail to follow community standards and
cross the boundary of self-limit, hurting other people, sometimes
leading to cyberbullying. Social media mining is the frontier
where researchers contend with ensuring safe cyberspace with the
help of robust information retrieval and data mining techniques.
In this paper, we are aiming towards achieving such a goal for
Bangla language-spoken people. We have created a corpus that
contains 11006 Bangla comments from Facebook, analyzed them
demographically, annotated them to create robust classifiers to
classify these comments as positive, negative, and neutral polarity.
We have decomposed these polarities to further sentiments
based on contents of the text varying from wishful thinking to
gender-based hate speech.
