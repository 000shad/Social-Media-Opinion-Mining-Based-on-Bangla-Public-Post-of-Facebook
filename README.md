# Social Media Opinion Mining Based on Bangla Public Post of Facebook
Social media holds the freedom to express anyone as
they are but sometimes people fail to follow community standards
and cross the boundary of self-limit, ending up hurting other
people and it sometimes leads to cyberbullying. Social media
mining is the frontier where with the help of powerful information
retrieval and data mining techniques, researchers contend
to ensure safe cyberspace. In this paper, we are aiming towards
achieving such a goal for Bengali language spoken people. We
have created a corpus that contains Bengali 11006 comments
from Facebook, analyzed them demographically, annotated them
to create powerful classifiers to classify these comments to
positive, negative and neutral polarity. We have decomposed
these polarities to further sentiments based on contents of the
text varying from wishful thinking to gender based hate speech.
